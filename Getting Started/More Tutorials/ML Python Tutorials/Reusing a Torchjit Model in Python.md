Reusing a Torchjit Model in Python:

In the detection and tracking tutorial, we have seen how we can use the Metavision ML module for detection and tracking.

The model we provide is a torchjit, which means that you can also directly access the model using the Torch library.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use our pretrained model with Torch and how to extract the features generated from the model.
