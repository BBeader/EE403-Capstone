Detection and Tracking Tutorial:

In this tutorial, we learn how to use a pretrained network for the detection and tracking of cars and pedestrians. At the end of this tutorial, we will have a full pipeline that takes events in input and outputs the position and id of cars and pedestrians in the field of view.
